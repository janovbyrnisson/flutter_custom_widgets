# flutter_custom_widgets

A sample Flutter project that uses a custom widget created from scratch using RenderObjects.

## Getting Started

Run create command before starting, since I didn't include the platform specific code, as it is not needed here.
```flutter create .```

Then get the packages:
```flutter pub get```

And run the app:
```flutter run -d [DEVICE]```
